# Tableau
This repository contains Tableau projects files for two projects:

1. Climate Change and Disaster Displacement: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Tableau to discover insights and generate patterns about the interrelation of Climate Change and Disaster Displacement using data collected from 2008 - 2021 from Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre or IDMC.

2. Forest Fires: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Tableau to discover insights and generate patterns about the causes and effects of forest fires in various jurisdictions of Canada between years 1990 and 2020 using data from Statistics Canada.

### Climate Change and Disaster Displacement
This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Tableau to discover insights and generate patterns about the interrelation of Climate Change and Disaster Displacement. The data used in this project was collected from 2008 - 2021 from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre or IDMC.

The project explores the impact of climate change on displacement and migration, the causes of displacement, and the countries and regions most affected by displacement. The project also includes visualizations of the trends in displacement caused by different types of natural disasters.

### Forest Fires
This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Tableau to discover insights and generate patterns about the causes and effects of forest fires in various jurisdictions of Canada between years 1990 and 2020 using data from Statistics Canada.

The project explores the trends in the number and severity of forest fires in different regions of Canada, the causes of forest fires, and the impact of forest fires on the environment and local communities. The project also includes visualizations of the trends in forest fires caused by different factors such as lightning, human activity, and equipment use.
